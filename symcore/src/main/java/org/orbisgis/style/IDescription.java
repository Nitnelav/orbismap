/**
 * This class intends to store a description of a {@code Rule}. It is made of
 * lists of title and abstract, and of sets of keywords. This class is built
 * to manage internationalization. As there can be only one title and one
 * abstract per language. Keywords are stored in a dedicated class.</p>
 * <p>According to 0GC 06-121r9, there shall be at most one title and/or
 * abstract per language. However, there may be many keywords associated to the
 * same language in a {@code Keywords} instance. In a {@code Description}
 * instance, there shall be at most one {@code Keywords} instance associated
 * to an authority.</p>
 * <p>Authorities are defined only considering the URI contained in the {@code
 * codeSpace} attribute of the {@code CodeType} element contained in {@code
 * Keywords}, according to 0GC 06-121r9. As there shall not be more than one
 * {@code Keywords} instance associated to a single authority, we map keywords
 * on this authority, ie only on the {@code URI}. The {@code CodeType} is not
 * considered meaningful in this mapping.
